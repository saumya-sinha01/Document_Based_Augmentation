The project involves developing a Python web service and creating test cases for generating synthetic image data using YoloV8 model, PyTesseract, and different python librarires. This synthetic data is generated by manipulating the text within images of insurance forms, which are then uploaded into a computer vision machine learning model software. The data manipulation tasks include adding text, removing text, replacing text, and replacing all instances of similar text within the forms.
