The project involves developinga Python web app for text augmentation in images, creating synthetic training data for a computer vision ML model. The app leverages docTR, YOLOv8, and LayoutLMv3 for text detection and extraction, and uses PyTesseract for text augmentation within images. It includes functionalities such as text search, addition, and removal within image forms.
